\chapter{Development of Adiabatic Quantum Computing}
\section{Feynman to Shor}
The initial idea of using quantum mechanics to carry out computation is usually attributed to Feynman \cite{feynman}.
\section{Development of AQC}
The idea of expanding simulated annealing to include quantum effects to solve problems was initially introduced by Kadowaki and Nishimori\cite{transverse}.
