\chapter{The \machine Machine}
\label{chap:machine}
\section{Machine Description}
The \machine machine on which our experiments were conducted is composed of 512 rf-SQUID superconducting qubits of the type described in \cite{qubit} \cite{dwave_nature}. It is the same physical machine as the larger of the two machines described in \cite{pudenz}.

Each qubit consists of a super-conducting Josephson junction, with left and right circulating currents serving the roles of $\uparrow$/$\downarrow$ or logical 1/0.  A super-conducting flux qubit is essentially a LC oscillator circuit (the flux $\Phi$ and the charge $Q$ have the commutator $[\Phi,Q]=i\hbar$ leading to harmonic oscillator behaviour) with an additional thin insulating layer inserted into the circuit; cooper pairs can tunnel through the insulating layer.  In general, Josephson-junction qubit circuits have contributions from inductance, capacitance and current, with the following potential:\cite{qc}

\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{U}(\Phi) = E_J\left[1 - \cos\left(2\pi \frac{\Phi_{ex}-\Phi}{\Phi_0}\right)\right] + \frac{\Phi^2}{2L}
\end{equation}
where $\Phi_0$ is the flux quantum ($h/2e$), $E_J$ is the Josephson energy, $L$ is the inductance of the loop, and $\Phi_{ex}$ is the bias flux.  In our case the \machine machine uses flux qubits, where the bias flux is roughly equal to the flux quantum: $\Phi_{ex} \approx \Phi_0/2$.  This causes two wells of equal energy, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:josephson}.

Figure \ref{fig:josephson} shows both a diagram of a qubit and a corresponding coupler, and also the energy structure of the Josephson junction.  Each well of the double well potential corresponds to one of left or right circulating current.  This can be modelled as a two-level system, although in reality there are multiple other energy levels both in the wells and above them and above the wells themselves.  Qubits occupying higher energy levels within the wells is generally not a problem, because the machine measures magnetization at the end and measuring a state higher in a well will produce the same net result.\cite{qubit}
Qubits occupying even higher energy states (delocalized across both wells) will result in incorrect results, and the method for dealing with this is to run the machine as cold as possible to reduce the likelihood of thermal excitation to those states. Because AQC is statistical even in the absence of machine failures of this kind (because we never reach the adiabatic limit), these higher excited states are not a major weakness.

\section{Programming the \machine}
\label{sec:machine_prog}
Each qubit and coupler is attached to another SQUID called a $\Phi$-DAC which allows them to be programmed.  The $\Phi$-DACs are controlled by classical circuitry and according to the binary input they are given induce a flux quantum in their superconducting loops.  A $\Phi$-DAC attached to a qubit controls the field term $h_i$ on the qubit by modifying the bias flux $\Phi_{ex}$, while a $\Phi$-DAC attached to a coupler controls the coupling between two qubits by scaling the strength of the qubit-coupler-qubit interaction according to the number of flux quanta in the $\Phi$-DAC.  The $\Phi$-DACs on the \machine are capable of containing between zero and seven flux quanta of either polarization, giving 4-bit precision for both the fields and couplings.  For more detail about the design of the programming hardware see Bunyk et. al.\cite{bunyk}

\section{Resolution}
\label{sec:resolution}
As discussed in Section \ref{sec:machine_prog}, the \machine machine cannot implement arbitrary physical Hamiltonians.  The machine can only implement fields and couplings as one of 15 distinct values: $-7/7, -6/7 \dots 5/7,6/7, 7/7$ corresponding to the number of flux quanta inside each $\Phi$-DAC.  Call the largest coupling present in the problem Hamiltonian $C_{max}$, and the smallest \emph{magnitude} coupling $C_{min}$.  As our Hamiltonians don't generally have a $C_{max}$ to $C_{min}$ distance of exactly 7, the machine must manipulate them to fit in this range.
First  all the field and coupling values are normalized into the range $[-1..1]$, and then each coupling is coerced to the nearest machine implemented value.
Unfortunately we don't know exactly how the coercion is done, because D-Wave has not released much information about the classical software side of the \machine.  It seems reasonable that each normalized coupling would be rounded to the nearest machine implemented coupling, but other schemes such as rounding toward or away from zero are possible.
The linear spacing of the machine implemented couplings implies that Hamiltonians with couplings that linearly fill the range from $-C_{max}$ to $C_{max}$ will be least affected by the coercing issue, while those Hamiltonians which have gaps between coupling values or other spacings will be most impacted by the effects of finite machine resolution.

	\caption[Ideal vs. Physical Couplings]{This figure illustrates the difference between ideal and physically implemented couplings; the blue $\delta$-function like peaks are what ideal couplings would behave as, and the Gaussians what a real machine must implement.  The amount of overlap between the tails of the real couplings is dependent on the magnitude of the programming noise in the machine; the actual amount of overlap present in the \machine machine is unknown.}

\section{Annealing Schedule}
As previously stated in Chapter \ref{chap:aqc} the form of the Hamiltonian we use for AQC is

\begin{equation}
	\ham_{tot} = A(t)\ham_i + B(t)\ham_f
\end{equation}

and in our case the experiments were carried out with a transverse field of $A(0) \approx 33.8 $ GHz and a maximum normalized coupling value of $B(T) \approx 20.5$ GHz, and an annealing temperature of 17 mK.  These correspond to energies of 140 $\mu$eV and 85 $\mu$eV for the Hamiltonian components respectively and a thermal energy of 1.5 $\mu$eV.  The particular values of $A$ and $B$ as a function of time are shown in Figure \ref{fig:trajectory}.

\end{figure}

\section{Programming Noise}
\label{sec:noise}
The resolution issue is exacerbated by the fact that there is some error in the programming of each coupling (or field).  Ideally one could imagine the physical coupling values implemented by the machine as a series of $\delta$-functions from $-C_{max}$ to $C_{max}$; however, because the couplings are non-ideal, the actual structure of the couplings looks more like Figure \ref{fig:coupling_spread}.  These errors arise because each of the SQUID elements making up the machine are subject to physical flaws; the qubits, the couplers and the programming elements ($\Phi$-DACs). In addition there are errors that occur each time the machine is programmed, coming from stray inductance or thermal noise or and other things.  The magnitude of the resulting programming error is uncertain; efforts are underway to quantify how much error is consistent with results from the machine \cite{aaron}.  If the overlap between adjacent programmable coupling values is large enough, then the Hamiltonian which is actually implemented during a particular run may have a different ground state then what we wished to program in; the larger the overlap, the more likely to get incorrect ground states.  The preliminary results in Chapter \ref{chap:prelim} suggest that the programming noise is in the neighbourhood of the machine coupling spacing, or large enough that it is possible for the programming noise to cause incorrect ground states.

\section{Inoperable Qubits}
\label{sec:inop_qubits}
Not every qubit on the \machine machine is functional all of the time.  As the machine is cooled to super-conducting temperatures, lines of magnetic flux can become trapped inside.  As some parts cool past the critical temperature before others, the Meissner effect forces magnetic flux out of the super-conducting regions into the regions which are still above the critical temperature.  If the regions of trapped flux are surrounded by super-conducting regions, there is no way for the trapped flux to escape and so it remains inside the machine, hindering the operation of whichever qubits it intersects.  As in the normal course of operation the machine is brought above super-conducting temperatures only for maintenance, the pattern of broken qubits can remain stable for long periods of time.  Figure \ref{fig:broken_qubits} shows the layout of the \machine machine, with the qubits that were inoperable for the duration of this study marked in red.

The presence of such inoperable qubits lowers the size of the Hamiltonians we can embed more than is at first obvious.  Even though the number of inoperable qubits is fairly small, the embedding algorithm (see Chapter \ref{chap:embed}) requires many qubits to embed the connections in a given Hamiltonian.  As a result, in the case where there are 9 disabled qubits the largest embeddable complete graph shrinks from 32 spins to 29, a 10\% decrease in size for losing only 2\% of the spins.  This demonstrates how reliant on the connectivity of the hardware graph the embedding process is.
