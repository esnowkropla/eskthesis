\chapter{The \texttt{VESUVIUS} Machine}

\section{Resolution}
In addition to the graph-shape restrictions, the \texttt{VESUVIUS} machine cannot implement arbitrary physical Hamiltonians.  The machine can only implement fields and couplings as one of 15 distinct values: $-7/7, -6/7 \dots 5/7,6/7, 7/7$.  As our embedded Hamiltonians don't generally have these coupling values, they must be manipulated to fit in this range.
First we normalize all the field and coupling values into the range $[-1..1]$, and then coerce the coupling to the nearest machine implemented value.
