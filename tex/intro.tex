\chapter{Introduction}
Quantum computing is the study of computers which operate according to the laws of quantum mechanics rather than the laws of classical physics.  Quantum computers are theorized to be faster than classical computers because quantum algorithms for integer factorization\cite{shor} and global search\cite{grover} have been found that are asymptotically faster than the best known classical algorithms, although it is not proven that there are no equivalent classical algorithms.
