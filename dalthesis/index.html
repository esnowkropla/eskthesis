<h3><a href="#toc">^</a> <a href="#introduction-d" name="introduction-d">1.1 FGS Regulations</a></h3>


<p>
The final thesis format is approved by the Faculty of Graduate Studies office.
Although this format is regularly maintained in an effort to keep it
up to date with the prescribed FGS guidelines, it is possible that
some additional corrections will be required.
The students are responsible for ensuring that their final thesis
conforms to the FGS regulations, especially since LaTeX allows
authors to override many aspects of the template within their own
text.
Hence, make sure that you have your thesis format checked by FGS
before trying to submit the final copy of your thesis.
<b>This evaluation takes two business days.</b>
</p>

<p>The FGS thesis regulations can be found at
<a href="http://www.dalgrad.dal.ca/regulations/ix/">
         http://www.dalgrad.dal.ca/regulations/ix/</a>.
Further thesis format guidelines, including sample theses documents in
Word format, are provided at:
<a href="http://dalgrad.dal.ca/currentstudents/thesesanddefences/forms/#regs">
http://dalgrad.dal.ca/currentstudents/thesesanddefences/forms/#regs</a>.

<p>
This template is provided as an example of something that FGS will
accept.  Students are welcome to make their thesis look as they want,
whether by using their own template or by modifying this one, but always
<b>have your thesis format checked by FGS before trying to submit the final
copy of your thesis.</b>

<h3><a href="#toc">^</a> <a href="#introduction-2" name="introduction-2">1.2 Other LaTeX Templates</a></h3>


<p>
At an ad-hoc committee meeting on Jun 14, 2012, it was decided that a
common Dalhousie LaTeX thesis template to be created, and this site is
the result of such effort.
A number of other LaTeX templates at the Dalhousie University exist, and
here is a list of them (if you know of any other, please
email Vlado Keselj at vlado@cs.dal.ca):
<ul>
<li> Math and Stats: <a href="http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~clyde/dalthesis/index.html">http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~clyde/dalthesis/index.html</a>
  <br>This is the oldest thesis template, created by Clyde Clements.
<li> Computer Science: <a href="http://web.cs.dal.ca/~vlado/dalcsthesis/">http://web.cs.dal.ca/~vlado/dalcsthesis/</a>
   <br>The Computer Science template is replaced with the dalthesis template (this template), and
      will be removed.  It was adapted from the Math templated by
      Clyde Clements by Mike McAllister and Vlado Keselj.
<li> Oceanography: <a href="https://github.com/dankelley/dal-oce-thesis">https://github.com/dankelley/dal-oce-thesis</a>
   <br>The Oceanography template is maintained by Dan Kelly.
</ul>

<h3><a href="#toc">^</a> <a href="#introduction-o" name="introduction-o">1.3 Overview of Main Commands</a></h3>


<p>
The LaTeX template for theses at the Dalhousie University is based on
version 2.9 of the CS template, which was based on version 2.2 of the template
for theses in Mathematics.
The math template was developed by Clyde Clements and Steven Matheson.
The basic usage of this template is similar to the Math one.
Some features may not be documented here, so you can also see instructions of
the Math template at
<a href="http://www.mscs.dal.ca/~clyde/dalthesis">www.mscs.dal.ca/~clyde/dalthesis</a>
or the basic <a href="example-simple/simple.tex">simple.tex</a> starter file
to get started and for the regular bells and whistles. 
</p>

<p>
Declare your supervisor with a \supervisor{} statement and each reader with
a \reader{} statement.  If you have co-supervisors, declare each of them with
a separate \supervisor{} statement and the template will designate them as
co-supervisors.
</p>

<p>
The basic template allows you to not print out the front pages if you
include a \nofront command in your file.
You can omit specific parts with the following commands:
\notitlepage, \nosignaturepage, \nopermissionpage \nodedicationpage, 
\notableofcontents, \nolistoftables, \nolistoffigures, or \nobib.
You can also declare a "draft" version of the thesis with the \draft command.
</p>

<p>
You can browse the file dalthesis.cls to find all degree tags.
For example, the following ones are relevant to the Faculty of Computer Science:
</p>
<ul>
<li> \bcshon &mdash; Bachelor of Computer Science Honours thesis</li>
<li> \bcshoncoop &mdash; Bachelor of Computer Science Honours thesis (with co-op) </li>
<li> \macs &mdash; Master of Applied Computer Science project report</li>
<li> \mcs &mdash; Master of Computer Science thesis</li>
<li> \mec &mdash; Master of Electronic Commerce thesis</li>
<li> \mhi &mdash; Master of Health Informatics thesis</li>
<li> \phd &mdash; Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Use one of these designations before your \frontmatter call and it will
define the appropriate abbreviations for your thesis.
</p>

<p>
A thesis file may rely on some additional style files.  All of them
are typically available on a system with installed LaTeX, but if a
required style file is not available, you can place their copies in
the directory with your thesis.
</p>

<p>
The basic files needed are:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="dalthesis.cls">dalthesis.cls</a> -- thesis class file</li>
<li> <a href="afterpage.sty">afterpage.sty</a></li>
<li> <a href="glossary.sty">glossary.sty</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
<a href="example-simple/simple.tex">Simple.tex</a>
(<a href="example-simple/simple.pdf">pdf</a>,
<a href="example-simple/simple.ps">ps</a>) 
is a sample basic thesis, which may be a good start file to write a thesis.
To process it, you also need its bibliography file
<a href="example-simple/simple.bib">simple.bib</a>.  All these files are
available in the directory example-simple.
</p>

<p>
The rest of this page provides information on including different
features in your thesis like a glossary, tables, or figures.
They are presented as changes to simple.tex.  Taking a UNIX "diff" between
simple.tex and the example will show you the items that change to use
the given feature.
</p>

<h3><a href="#toc">^</a> <a href="#introduction-c" name="introduction-c">1.4 Caveats</a></h3>


<h4>Page Margins</h4>

<p>
FGS guidelines specify that the left-side margin should be around 1.5
inches and other three margins approximately 1 inch.  The thesis style
file is designed to satisfy this requirement but, as Clyde Clements
mentions in the math version of the thesis template, you
may print the thesis generated by this template and get incorrect
margins.
Known reasons are
<ul>
<li> You selected the wrong paper size when you converted the dvi file
     to postscript (use the correct option for dvips).</li> 
<li> You generated a PDF file and then, as you printed from Adobe
     Acrobat, you had the "fit to page" option selected, which
     decreases the printed text by 93%.  (unselect the "fit to page"
     option before printing)</li>
</ul>
Once the DVI file is generated, this template is no longer in control.
The version that was approved by graduate studies was generated to a
postscript file and then printed directly to a printer with the lpr
command.
</p>

<p>
The easiest way to tell if your margins are correct after printing is to 
measure where the page number appears at the bottom of a page.  The template
is designed to print it between 0.5 inches and 0.75 inches from the bottom 
of the page.  If the margin is bigger than that then your method of printing
the dvi file has shrunk the margins.
</p>


<h3><a href="#toc">^</a> <a href="#introduction-b" name="introduction-b">1.5 Current Issues</a></h3>


<p>
Although an effort is made to keep the template in accordance with the
latest FGS regulations, it happens that a thesis using the template
does not conform to some requirements.  We greatly appreciate any
reports about the corrections, and our first step is to list such
issues in this subsection.  Additionally, we report here any other reported problems.
</p>


<ul>
<li> PDF/A format<br>
     Since the required electronic submission, the FGS regulations
     require that the PDF file is in PDF/A format, which is not
     produced by default by pdflatex and most other programs.
     Some conversion suggestions are offered at:
     <a href="http://dalgrad.dal.ca/currentstudents/thesesanddefences/etheses/"
             >http://dalgrad.dal.ca/currentstudents/thesesanddefences/etheses/"</a>

<li> issue with using the package: <code>\usepackage{listings}</code><br>
     When an appendix chapter consists entierly of a long, multi-page code segment, the page
     immediatelly after the first chapter page is blank.

     A quick solution is to redefine the \dal@chapter command in the following way,
     somewhere in preamble (before \begin{document}) of your thesis:
<pre>
\makeatletter
\def\dal@chapter[#1]#2{%
\ifnum \c@secnumdepth >\m@ne\refstepcounter{chapter}%
\typeout{\@chapapp\space\thechapter.}%
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}%
{\protect\numberline{\@chapapp\space\thechapter}#1}%
\else\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{#1}%
\fi\chaptermark{#1}%
\addtocontents{lof}{\protect\addvspace{10\p@}}%
\addtocontents{lot}{\protect\addvspace{10\p@}}%
\if@twocolumn\@topnewpage[\@makechapterhead{#2}]%
\else\@makechapterhead{#2}%
\@afterheading\fi%
%\ifdal@in@preface\else\afterpage{\dal@add@textheight{\footskip}}\fi%
}
\makeatother
</pre>

This should be done just before the first code appendix chapter.
Thanks to Mike Lawrence for reporting this problem.

<li> When using dotted leaders to separate entries from page number,
     ensure that at least three dots can fit between the end of your
     entry and the page number (list of tables, list of figures, table
     of contents).

<p> One solution can be illustrated as follows:
<pre>
\section[This Section Title is Very Close to the Length of Two Lines
 in the Table of Contents---There Should be Two Dots at the End of
 ToC Line~.~.]
{This Section Title is Very Close to the Length of Two Lines
 in the Table of Contents---There Should be Two Dots at the End of
 ToC Line}
</pre>
This is a trick to repeat the title for the short and long version, but we add ~.~. in the "short" version.
This makes the title in the Table of Contents longer, and makes sure that there are at least
two dots in the dotted line, as required.


<li> In table and figure captions, we can use the following style:
<pre>
\caption[caption title]{actual caption text}
</pre>
instead of
<pre>
\caption{caption text}
</pre>
In the first case only the caption title will appear in the table of
contents.  The first usage is encouraged if the caption text takes
more than one line.
<li>
    There is a new command, \mixedCaseTitle, which should be
    documented.  The command negates the
    code to capitalize the title.  If you absolutely need mixed
    case in the title (like a chemistry person who might need NaCl
    in the title with that casing) then invoke the no-parameter
    \mixedCaseTitle command and you now control the case title.
</ul>

<h3><a href="#toc">^</a> <a href="#front" name="front">2.1 Front Pages</a></h3>


<p>
According to current regulations, an abstract should occupy a single
page.
It may be typeset in the single space mode, if necessary.  To obtain
the single-space mode you need to specify the beginning tag as:
<pre>
\begin{abstract}[s]
</pre>
instead of the usual
<pre>
\begin{abstract}
</pre>
The abstract should have no illustrations or footnotes, and it should
be no longer than 150 words for a Master's thesis, and not longer than
350 words for a PhD thesis.  This is not a strict requirement, but it
is required by the catalogues: the AMICUS Web on-line catalogue and
Dissertations Abstracts International database.

<h3><a href="#toc">^</a> <a href="#figure" name="figure">2.2 Figures</a></h3>


<p>
The example included here uses two LaTeX subpackages: graphicx and subfigure.
The graphicx package is quite common and useful to include external images.
The current FGS requirements (2011-04) require that a thesis is
submitted in the PDF format, for the electronic submission, and
it should be PDF/A compliant.  This requires that all fonts are
embedded, among other requirements.  To obtain such format, it is
recommended that you use pdflatex, instead of producing a DVI file and
then a PS file.  All EPS figures need to be converted to PDF as well.
You can use epstopdf command (in Linux environment) to convert an EPS
figure to PDF.  For example, to convert a f.eps file to pdf, type
"epstopdf f.eps", and it will produce "f.pdf" file, usable as a figure
by pdflatex.

<p>
This example uses two sub-packages:  graphicx and subfigure.
graphicx is a standard package that gives you everything you need for
figures.  The subfigure package is used here to place more than one
picture (each with their own caption) within one figure.

<p>
The example <a href="examples/theorems.tex">theorems.tex</a> 
(<a href="examples/theorems.pdf">pdf</a>) illustrates how we can write
definitions, theorems, proofs, and other similar parts in LaTeX.

<p>
For proofs and proof sketches you can also use the style package
written by Norbert Zeh, <a href="examples/nzproof.sty">nzproof.sty</a>.
The package requires the following other style files: amsmath.sty,
amssymb.sty, amsfonts.sty, and ifthen.sty, which are likely already
installed on the system.
This example shows how nzproof style file can be used.
Thanks to Norbert Zeh for providing the style file and the sample
LaTeX source.

<h3><a href="#toc">^</a> <a href="#glossary" name="glossary">2.6 Glossary</a></h3>


<p>
This example creates a glossary.  The example uses the file
<a href="glossary.sty">glossary.sty</a>, which may be installed on
your system, or you can download it
from <a href="glossary.sty">here</a>.
To create a glossary, you first LaTeX the file, then issue the command:
<pre>
makeindex -s glossary.ist -o glossary.gls glossary.glo
</pre>
and finally LaTeX the file once more.
</p>

<p>
In a thesis, as well as in this example, the location of the glossary
is dictated by the Faculty of Graduate Studies:
it must be between the abstract and the acknowledgements.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="example-glossary/glossary.tex">glossary.tex</a> (<a
href="example-glossary/glossary.pdf">pdf</a>) &mdash; LaTeX file with a

<p>
The dalthesis template arose out of the efforts of many people.
Particular thanks go to the following contributors:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Clyde Clements and Steven Matheson for providing the base
     Math template from which the CS template arose,</li>
<li> Mike McAllister for the <b>main</b> work on adaptation of the
     Computer Science template, integration of the updates below,
     and producing this web page, and examples.</li>
<li> Todd Eavis, Andrew Rau-Chaplin, Billy Biggs, Srini Sampalli, 
     and Stuart MacAskill for providing examples of how they adjusted 
     the math template to adapt to the FGS regulations as they were getting 
     their theses approved.  In particular, Todd provided the foundation, 
     algorithm, and figures of the bigger thesisExample sample thesis.  </li>
<li> Norbert Zeh for looking over the finishing touches of the template and for
     providing a proof environment.  </li>
<li> Vlado Keselj for some <strong>major</strong> latex hacking to address 
     the FGS requirements that will go unnoticed by most 
     non-FGS people but that are some of the trickier details to integrate 
     simply and seamlessly in the class file.</li>
<li> Mike Smit for providing additional corrections from FGS.</li>
<li> Li Lei for providing corrections.</li>
<li> Sajjad Hussain for providing corrections.</li>
<li> Mike McAllister created and maintained the CS thesis template in the
     period from 2005 to 2006.
<li> Vlado Keselj and Mike McAllister maintained the CS thesis template
     in the period from 2006 to 2012.
<li> Vlado Keselj modified dalcsthesis template into general dalthesis
     template in 2012.
</ul>

<h3><a href="#toc">^</a> <a href="#history-u" name="history-u">3.2 Update History</a></h3>


The following template history notes are given in reversed chronological order:
<ul>
<li> 2013-Oct-01 -- VK: glossary files added (fixing)</li>
<li> 2013-Jun-24 -- VK: Version 1.1
     <ul><li> Implemented the format change from FGS: removal of pages
     ii and iii; the signature page and the permission page.
     </ul>
<li> 2012-Nov-13 -- Vlado Keselj: <b>dalthesis.cls</b> created from dalcsthesis.cls;
       documentation improvements;</li>
<li> 2012-Jun-14 -- VK: documentation improvements </li>
<li> 2012-Jun-01 -- VK: documentation improvements </li>
<li> 2011-Apr-05 -- VK: documentation improvements (figures)</li>
<li> 2011-Jan-21 -- VK: front page updates, fixing spacing</li>
<li> 2010-Jan-05 -- VK: minor documentation updates </li>
<li> 2008-Sep-05 -- VK: issue with the package listings (empty page)
<li> 2008-Jun-14 -- VK: minor documentation and examples updates (glossary)
<li> 2007-Sep-18 -- VK: Version 2.8
       <ul><li> fixed bug with PhD thesis: Previously, signatures appeared on the next (wrong)
                page because there are five of them;
       <li> minor documentation and "big example" updates,
       <li> added phd-example
       </ul>
</ul>

and the rest in chronological order.  (It is a work in progress...)

<ul>
<li> Feb, 2005 -- Created by Mike McAllister, and changes below are
     done by Mike unless marked otherwise.
<li> Feb. 23, 2005 -- new thesis class file uploaded
  with some margin and font size fixes.  The index was also removed
  from examples since grad studies doesn't want an index.</li>
<li> Feb. 24, 2005 -- new thesis class file again and glossary example.  
Vlado made the glossary into an option of the thesis class so that we
can modify its line spacing to what FGS wants.  Way to go Vlado!</li>
<li> Feb. 25, 2005 -- Added in a disclaimer and indicated that students
are welcome to submit whatever thesis format FGS will accept; this template
is just a suggestion.  Reformatted the acknowledgements section.</li>
<li> Feb. 25, 2005 --  Made the distinction between \submitdate{} (title
page) and \defencedate{} (signature pages) since the latter requires a
full date while the former only asks for the month and year.  If you
have a thesis that uses a prior version of the template, you will need
to add a \defencedate{} clause with the new thesis template!</li>
<li> Mar. 17, 2005 -- Indicate that the template passes the requirements
of FGS.  Updated the list of files required by nzproof.sty too.</li>
<li> Mar. 22, 2005 -- Added a note about how to have co-supervisors.</li>
<li> Mar. 29, 2005 -- Added information about paper margins and on not
printing some parts of the text. </li>
<li> Apr. 6, 2005 -- Added the "random information" section to document
that the thesis must still be reviewed by FGS and that the abstract has 
a limited size.</li>
<li> Apr. 21, 2005 -- Graduate committee approved the template.
<li> Apr. 28, 2005 -- Maintainer: Vlado Keselj
<li> Aug. 31, 2006 -- Maintainers: Mike McAllister and Vlado Keselj
<li> Nov. 18, 2006 -- Mike Mcallister adapted version 2.6 from version 2.5 as
       required by FGS:
       <ul>
       <li> Title must be capitalized everywhere.  Added command
            \mixedCaseTitle to in case the title needs mixed case, at
	    which point the author of the dissertation takes on the
	    responsibility of getting the case right.
       <li> Even spacing on title bage between title, "by" and author name
       <li> Put lower part of title page in single space
       <li> Capitalized words on author signature page as required
       </ul>
<li> Dec. 1, 2006 -- Vlado Keselj updated the examples and the
       documentation.
<li> Dec. 4, 2006 -- Vlado Keselj updated the examples and the
       documentation.
<li> Dec. 5, 2006 -- Vlado Keselj: Version 2.7, Bachelor of Computer Science,
    Honours is submitted to FCS instead of FGS.  Updates of examples
    and documentation.
<li> Jan 4, 2007 -- Vlado Keselj: - minor documentation updates
<li> Mar 8, 2007 -- Vlado Keselj: - minor documentation updates
<li> Aug 30, 2007 -- Vlado Keselj: - minor documentation updates
</ul>
